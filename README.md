# predicting-customer-churn
Data Collection: Gather data from various sources like CRM systems, customer interactions, and transaction histories.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models. Commonly used algorithms include:

Decision Trees: Split data based on feature values to make predictions.

Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy.

Logistic Regression: Predicts the probability of a binary outcome.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space.

Model Training: Train the selected model on historical data where the churn outcome is known.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

Deployment: Implement the model to predict churn in real-time or on new data.
